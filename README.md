# SMILe
This project will provide a highly customized Music newsletter.
The subscriber provides a list of artists and his location and gets the most recent and most interesting information about these Artists.
These include their latest tweets, dates on concerts near the subscriber as well as new songs on YouTube, as well as albums on sale on Amazon.
The main method of delivery will be via Email, as a daily digest in the evening. Additionally, a daily YouTube playlist will be delivered in the morning to start the day with the subscriber’s favorite music. 
Another important point for people who are using “SMILe” is, that they are always up-to-date in respect of their favourite artists.
